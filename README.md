# Super Bunny Strikes Back: Webxdc Port

This is a Webxdc port of the [Super Bunny Strikes Back](https://github.com/foumart/JS.13kGames.2019_SuperBunny) game.
The game has no music originally and was
enhanced by the incredible sound engine [ZzFXM](https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM)
playing "Sanxion" by Rob Hubbard 🙏

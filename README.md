> Player starts hopping from the left side of the screen to the right on scrolling platforms. The goal is to avoid the creatures that appear on the platforms and reach the power-up on the right side of the screen. Taking the power-up turns the player into Super Kitty/Bunny, at which point he must dispatch all creatures to clear the stage and proceed to the next one.
